A **homomorphism of Lie groups** is a smooth map $f: G \to H$ between two Lie groups $G$ and $H$ that is also a group homomorphism. This means it preserves both the group operation and the smooth manifold structure. Let's break it down:

### Definition
A map $f: G \to H$ between Lie groups $G$ and $H$ is a **Lie group homomorphism** if:
1. **Group homomorphism**: $\forall g, h \in G$, $f(g \cdot h) = f(g) \times f(h)$, where $\cdot$ and $\times$ are the group operations in $G$ and $H$, respectively.
2. **Smoothness**: $f$ is a smooth map between the underlying smooth manifolds of $G$ and $H$.

If $f$ is also a diffeomorphism (a smooth bijection with a smooth inverse), it is called a **Lie group isomorphism**.

### Induced Lie Algebra Homomorphism
A Lie group homomorphism $f: G \to H$ induces a **Lie algebra homomorphism** between the corresponding Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g} = T_e G$ and $\mathfrak{h} = T_e H$, where $T_e G$ and $T_e H$ are the tangent spaces at the identity elements of $G$ and $H$. The induced map is:

$$df_e: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h},$$

the differential of $f$ at the identity $e \in G$. This map $df_e$ is linear and preserves the Lie bracket:

$$df_e([X, Y]_{\mathfrak{g}}) = [df_e(X), df_e(Y)]_{\mathfrak{h}},$$

for all $X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}$.

### Examples
1. **Exponential Map**: For a matrix Lie group $G \subseteq GL(n, \mathbb{R})$, the exponential map $\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$, defined by $\exp(X) = e^X$, is not generally a Lie group homomorphism unless restricted to specific cases, but it relates the Lie algebra to the Lie group.
2. **Linear Groups**: The map $f: \mathbb{R} \to SO(2)$, given by $t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \cos t & -\sin t \\ \sin t & \cos t \end{pmatrix}$, is a Lie group homomorphism from the additive group $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ to the rotation group $SO(2)$.
3. **Covering Maps**: The map $f: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$, $t \mapsto e^{i t}$, is a Lie group homomorphism from $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ to the circle group $(S^1, \cdot)$.

### Properties
- **Kernel**: The kernel $\ker(f) = \{ g \in G \mid f(g) = e_H \}$ of a Lie group homomorphism is a closed normal Lie subgroup of $G$.
- **Image**: The image $f(G)$ is a Lie subgroup of $H$, though it may not be closed.
- **Isomorphism Theorems**: Lie group homomorphisms satisfy analogs of the standard group isomorphism theorems, adjusted for the smooth structure.

### Lie Algebra and Homomorphisms
The Lie algebra homomorphism $df_e$ captures the "infinitesimal" behavior of $f$. If $f$ is a Lie group homomorphism, the exponential maps intertwine via:

$$f \circ \exp_G = \exp_H \circ df_e,$$

meaning the diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{CD}
\mathfrak{g} @>df_e>> \mathfrak{h} \\
@V\exp_GVV @VV\exp_HV \\
G @>f>> H
\end{CD}
$$

### Applications
- Lie group homomorphisms are crucial in representation theory, where they describe how one Lie group can act on another via smooth transformations.
- They are used to study symmetries in physics, such as in gauge theories, where homomorphisms relate different symmetry groups.
- In geometry, they help classify Lie groups and their subgroups via their Lie algebras.

A **Lie group isomorphism** is a special case of a Lie group homomorphism where the map $f: G \to H$ between two Lie groups $G$ and $H$ is also a **diffeomorphism**. Let’s unpack this definition clearly and concisely.

### Definition
A map $f: G \to H$ between Lie groups $G$ and $H$ is a **Lie group isomorphism** if it satisfies two conditions:
1. **Group homomorphism**: $f$ preserves the group operation, i.e., for all $g, h \in G$, $f(g \cdot_G h) = f(g) \cdot_H f(h)$, where $\cdot_G$ and $\cdot_H$ are the group operations in $G$ and $H$.
2. **Diffeomorphism**: $f$ is a smooth bijection (one-to-one and onto) with a smooth inverse $f^{-1}: H \to G$. This means:
   - $f$ is a bijective map between the underlying smooth manifolds.
   - Both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are smooth (infinitely differentiable).

In other words, a Lie group isomorphism preserves both the **algebraic structure** (group operation) and the **smooth manifold structure** of the Lie groups, ensuring they are essentially identical as Lie groups.

### Implications
- **Algebraic equivalence**: Since $f$ is a group isomorphism, it establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of $G$ and $H$, preserving the group operation. This means $G$ and $H$ have the same group structure.
- **Geometric equivalence**: The diffeomorphism condition ensures that $G$ and $H$ have the same smooth manifold structure, so they are topologically and differentially indistinguishable.
- **Lie algebra isomorphism**: The differential $df_e: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ at the identity $e \in G$ is a Lie algebra isomorphism between the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g} = T_e G$ and $\mathfrak{h} = T_e H$. This means $df_e$ is a linear bijection that preserves the Lie bracket: $df_e([X, Y]_{\mathfrak{g}}) = [df_e(X), df_e(Y)]_{\mathfrak{h}}$.

### Example
Consider the Lie groups $\mathbb{R}$ (under addition) and $S^1$ (the circle group under multiplication). The map $f: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$, $t \mapsto e^{i t}$, is a Lie group homomorphism because it is smooth and satisfies $f(t + s) = e^{i(t+s)} = e^{i t} \cdot e^{i s} = f(t) \cdot f(s)$. However, it is **not** an isomorphism because it is not bijective ($f$ is surjective but not injective, as $t + 2\pi k$ maps to the same point for integer $k$).

Now consider a map between matrix Lie groups, like $f: SU(2) \to SO(3)$, which can be constructed via a specific homomorphism (e.g., the adjoint representation). If such a map were bijective and smooth with a smooth inverse, it would be a Lie group isomorphism, but in this case, $SU(2) \to SO(3)$ is a 2-to-1 covering map, so it’s not an isomorphism.

A true example of a Lie group isomorphism is the identity map $f: G \to G$ for any Lie group $G$, which is bijective, smooth, and preserves the group operation.

### Why It Matters
- A Lie group isomorphism shows that $G$ and $H$ are essentially the same Lie group, just presented differently (like viewing the same object from different perspectives).
- It induces an isomorphism between the Lie algebras, preserving their structure, which is useful for classifying Lie groups.
- In applications, such as in physics or geometry, isomorphisms help identify equivalent symmetry groups, simplifying the study of systems with identical structures.
