### General Linear Group
$GL_n(\mathbb{R}) = $ all _invertible_ $n \times n$ matrices $A$ with entries $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}$ 
$GL_n(\mathbb{C}) = $ all _invertible_ $n \times n$ matrices $A$ with entries $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{C}$ 
$GL_n(\mathbb{Q}) = $ all _invertible_ $n \times n$ matrices $A$ with entries $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{Q}$ 

All of these are groups $G$, meaning they are:
- A set with a product structure:
    $$a, b \in G, \quad a.b \in G$$
- Associative:
    $$a. (b.c) = (a.b).c$$
- Including an identity element $e$:
    $$a.e = e.a = a$$
- Including an inverse for each element:
    $$a.a^{-1} = a^{-1}.a = e$$

### Subgroups
Precisely, A group $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ (denoted as $H \subset G$) if it is a subset closed under the appropriate group operation, contains the identity element, and has inverses for each element.

### Symmetry (Ur) Group
The **Ur group** on a _set_ $T$:
$$
Sym(T) = \{\text{All bijections } a: T \rightarrow T \}
$$
Where **composition** is the group operation:
$$ (a.b) (t) = a(b(t))$$
The **identity** is the bijection which maps each element to itself.
And inverses exist because the elements are _bijections_.

Why do we talk about the _Ur Group_?
Because many groups arise as subgroups of groups of form $Sym(T)$.
e.g. $GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \subset Sym(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

$$
\begin{align*}
S_n :&= Sym \{1, 2, ..., n\} \\
&= \text{"Permutation group on } n \text{ letters"} \\
&= \text{"Symmetry group on } n \text{ letters"}
\end{align*}$$

This is a **finite** group of size $n!$. 
i.e. $|S_n| = n!$.

The different variations of it are:
$$
S_1 = \{e\} \\
$$
$$
\begin{align*}
S_2 = \{ \quad
&e: (1 \rightarrow 1, \, 2 \rightarrow 2) \\ 
&\tau : (1 \rightarrow 2, \, 2 \rightarrow 1) \\ \} 
\end{align*} \\
$$

Where the multiplication table becomes:

| .       | $e$    | $\tau$ |
|---      |---     | --     |
| $e$     | $e$    | $\tau$ |
| $\tau$  | $\tau$ | $e$    |

in particular, $\tau^{-1} = \tau$.

**Recall** that if for all $a, b \in G$, we have $ab = ba$, then we say the group is **Abelian** or **Commutative**.

So, $S_2$ is Abelian.

$$
\begin{align*}
S_3 = \{ \quad
&e, \\ 
&\tau : (1 \rightarrow 2, \, 2 \rightarrow 1, \, 3 \rightarrow 3) \\ 
&\tau' : (1 \rightarrow 1, \, 2 \rightarrow 3, \, 3 \rightarrow 2) \\
&\tau'' : (1 \rightarrow 3, \, 2 \rightarrow 2, \, 3 \rightarrow 1) \\
&\sigma : (1 \rightarrow 2, \, 2 \rightarrow 3, \, 3 \rightarrow 1) \\
&\sigma' : (1 \rightarrow 3, \, 2 \rightarrow 1, \, r \rightarrow 2) \\
\} 
\end{align*} \\
$$

The $\tau$ is called a **Transposition**, meaning it only changes $2$ elements of $T$.

**Note**: 
Tranpositions are always their own inverse.

_Question_: 
Is $S_3$ Abelian?

_Answer_:
No! Because $\tau \sigma \neq \sigma \tau$ (you can check for yourself!)
Note that $\tau^{-1} = \tau, \quad \sigma^{-1} = \sigma'$
(applies for $\tau', \tau''$ as well.)


**Corollary**:
The group $S_n $ is _non-Abelian_ for all $n \geq 3$.
_Proof_: 
$S_3 \subset S_n$. Basically, every element of $S_3$ can be thought of an element of $S_n$, assuming that the other letters $4, 5, ...$ are mapped to themselves.

**Note**:
For $k \leq n$, $S_k \subset S_n$.

### Example #1
_Question_:
What is the subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ which _stabilizes_ the line $y=0$?
(Meaning that every vector on the line $y=0$ will stay on that line after the tranformation)

**Note** that it's immediately clear that this is a subgroup, because composites stabilize, the identity stabilizes, and the inverses stabilize.

_Answer_: 
$$
H = \{A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} : \, ad \neq 0 \}
$$

Some trivial examples of subgroups of a group $G$ are:
$$
\{e\} \text{ is a subgroup for all groups } G
$$

<hr/>

### Example #2
_Proposition_:
The subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are precisely given by $(b \mathbb{Z}, +)$ for $b$ a fixed integer.

e.g. 
$b=0$ gives the subgroup $(0, +)$.
$b=1$ gives subgroup $H = G$.

_Proof_:
I feel like the proof is rather obvious, so I won't go through it here, just remember that if we have a set and we want to check whether it's a subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, we can use the Eucledian algorithm to find the smallest positive integer $b$ in there, then we can see if everything else is a multiple of that.

 <hr/>

### Generators
Let $G$ be any group, with $g \in G$, then we can have 
$$
\begin{align*}
H &= <g>
&= \{e, g, g^{-1},  g^2, g^{-2}, ... \}
&= \{g^m : m \in \mathbb{Z} \}
\end{align*}
$$
Which is the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$, which is also teh smallest subgroup containing $g$.

Note that $g^m . g^n = g^{m+n}$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
Similarly, $(g^m)^{-1} = g^{-m}$.

**Caveat**: We have to be careful not to think that these element need to be distinct.
For example, in $S_2$, $\langle \tau \rangle = \{e, \tau \}$. Since $\tau^2 = e$.

#### Order of a group
If $g^m = e$ and $m$ is the smallest such power, we say $m$ is the _order_ of the generator $g$.
If no power of $g$ is $e$, then we say that $g$ has infinite order.
