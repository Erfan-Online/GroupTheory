# Review
- $G \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} G'$ is a homomorphism $\iff f(g \cdot h) = f(g) \times f(h)$
- $f(e) = e'$
- $f(g^{-1}) = f(g)^{-1}$
- Composition: $G \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} G' \stackrel{h}{\rightarrow} G''$
- $h \circ f$ is a homomorphism if both $h$ and $f$ are homomorphisms.

## Image and kernel

Given a homomorphism $f: G \rightarrow G'$,

### Image
We can define the **image** of $f$ as the set of all elements $f(g)$ in $G'$:
$$
\text{Image}(f) = \{ f(g) : g \in G \} \subseteq G'
$$


_Analogous to the matrix image in linear algebra_, it is the set of all the _outputs_ of the function $f$ applied on the set $G$ that are in the co-domain of the set $G'$.

<br/>

### Kernel
The Kernel is defined as:

$$Kernel(f) = \{ g \in G: f(g) = e' \} \subset G$$

_Analogous to the matrix kernel in linear algebra_, it is the set of all of the _inputs_ of the function $f$ applied on the set $G$ whose output gets mapped to the identity element in the set $G'$.

**Note**: $f$ is an **isomorphism** if and only if both:
- Image$(f) = G'$ (surjective: everything in $G'$ gets mapped to)
- Kernel$(f) = \{ e \}$ (injective: only the identity element of $G$ maps to the identity in $G'$)

**Proof**: \
Suppose there exists $g_1, g_2 \in G$ such that $g_1 \neq g_2$ and $f(g_1) = f(g_2)$, then \
$f(g_1 \cdot g_2^{-1}) = f(g_1) \times f(g_2^{-1}) = f(g_2) \times f(g_2^{-1}) = e'$ \
$\Rightarrow (g_1 \cdot g_2^{-1}) = e$ (Because of the kernel)

Both conditions are necessary - having just one is insufficient for an isomorphism.

**Note**: If $G = G'$ and $f$ is an isomorphism, we say it's an **Automorphism**.

<br/>

# Normal Subgroups

Both the Kernel and Image of a homomorphism are subgroups, but Kernel is also a _special_ kind of subgroup, called a **Normal Subgroup**.

When saying $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, denoted as $H \triangleleft G$, we mean that 
$$
\forall g \in G, \quad \forall h, h' \in H, \\
ghg^{-1} = h' \\
$$
In other words, $H$ is "closed under conjugation" of $G$.

_Verification of Kernels being Normal subgroups_: 

$$
g \in G, \quad h \in Kernel(f)\\
\, \\
\begin{align*}
f(ghg^{-1}) &= f(g) \times f(h) \times f(g)^{-1} \\
&= f(g) \times e' \times f(g)^{-1} \\
&= f(g) \times f(g)^{-1} \times e' \\
&= e' \times e' \\
&= e'
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow ghg^{-1} \in Kernel(f)
$$
(Therefore, the kernel is **closed** under conjugation!)

**Note**:
Not all subgroups are normal. \
Example:
$$
G = S_3, \quad  H = \{ e, \tau \} \\ 
\, \\
\tau = \{ (1 \mapsto 2, 2 \mapsto 1, 3 \mapsto 3) \}
$$
This is not normal, since:
$$
\begin{align*}
\tau' \tau (\tau')^{-1} &= \tau'' \\
&= \{ (1 \mapsto 3, 2 \mapsto 2, 3 \mapsto 1) \}
\end{align*}
$$

So, for example, $H$ is not the kernel of a homomorphism.

Eventually, we'll see that: \
If  $H \triangleleft G$, there **exists** a homomorphism $f: G \rightarrow Q$ such that $Kernel(f) = H$. \
(For some group $Q$)

### Examples of Kernels and Images of homomorphisms:
1. For the determinant:
$$
G = GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} G' = \mathbb{R}^{\times} = GL_1(\mathbb{R}) \\
f(A) = det(A) \\ 
det(AB) = det(A) \times det(B)  \\
Image(f) = \mathbb{R}^{\times} \\
Kernel(f) = \{ A: det(A) = 1  \} =: SL_n(\mathbb{R}) \triangleleft GL_n(\mathbb{R})
$$

As we can see, the **Special Linear group** $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a normal subgroup of the general linear group, and is defined as the kernel of the determinant function. (aka matrices with determinant $1$)

**Note**:
The set of matrices with any fixed determinant value is stable under conjugation, since:

$$
\begin{align*} 
det(B A B^{-1}) 
&= det(B) \times det(A) \times det(B^{-1}) \\
&= det(B) \times det(A) \times det(B)^{-1} \\
&= det(A)
\end{align*}
$$

(Multiplication is commutative in $\mathbb{R}$)

<br/>

2. 
$$
f: S_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \\
\, \\
f(\sigma) = P_\sigma = \text{"Permutation matrix associated to } \sigma \text{"} \\
\, \\
P_\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
\ldots & 0 & \ldots & \ldots \\
\ldots & \vdots & \ldots & \ldots \\
\ldots & 1 & \ldots & \ldots \\
\ldots & \vdots & \ldots & \ldots  \\
\ldots & 0 & \ldots & \ldots
\end{pmatrix} \\
$$
Where in every column $j$, only the $\sigma(j)$-th entry is $1$, and the rest are $0$.

Example:
$$
G = S_3, \quad \sigma = \{ (1 \rightarrow 2, \, 2 \rightarrow 3, \, 3 \rightarrow 1) \} \\
\, \\
\Rightarrow P_\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The textbook has verified the fact that $f(\sigma \tau) = P_\sigma P_\tau$

$$
Image(f) = \text{"Set of permutation matrices"} \\
Kernel(f) = \{e \}
$$

**Fact**:
$$
det(f(\sigma)) = \pm 1 \quad \forall \sigma \in S_n
$$
And both values occur.


**Proof of fact**: Why are the determinants of permutation matrices $\pm 1$?

Because an elementary row switch matrix has determinant $âˆ’1$. \
You can easily verify that any permutation matrix can be written as a product of $t$ row switches on the identity matrix which has determinant $1$. \
Therefore the determinant of any permutation matrix is $(-1)^{t}$.
 
<br/>

3. Composition of 1. and 2. (denoted as $h$ here)
$$
S_n \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \stackrel{det}{\rightarrow} \mathbb{R}^{\times} \\
h = det \circ f \\
\, \\
Image(h) = \{ \pm 1 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^{\times} \\
Kernel(h) = \{ \sigma : h(\sigma) = + 1 \} =: A_n \triangleleft S_n
$$
The kernel here is called an **Alternating Group**, and we will show $|A_n| = \frac{|S_n|}{2} = \frac{n!}{2}$

$h$ is also called a _sign map_.

**Note**:
To avoid circularity, we defined $det$ independently of the formula involving signs of permutation matrices.

The elements of $A_n$ are called the **even permutations**.

**Note**:
There is also an alternative defintion of this "sign map":
- Write permutation as product of transposition, if there are an even number of transpositions in the product, then the sign is positive and otherwise negative.

For example:

In $S_3$, (which has order $6$) the even permutations are:
$$
e, \\\sigma = \{ (1 \rightarrow 2, \, 2 \rightarrow 3, \, 3 \rightarrow 1) \}, \\ 
\sigma' = \sigma^2
$$
Which makes them members of $A_3$ (which has order $3$).

And the odd permutations are:
$$
\tau, \tau', \tau''
$$

Now, why is $\sigma$ an even permutation? \
Because it can be written as a product of two transpositions:
$$
\sigma = (123) = (13) \times (23)
$$


### Centers and Inner Automorphisms

**Center of a group**:

Given a group $G$, we denote the **Center** of $G$ as $Z(G)$ which is defined as:
$$
Z(G) = \{ z \in G : zg = gz, \quad \forall g \in G \}
$$
Which is basically the set of those elements in $G$ which commute with all elements of $G$.

The **Center** is a _Normal Subgroup_ and it is _Abelian_.

Examples:
- $$G = Z(G) \iff G \text{ is Abelian}$$
- $$G = S_n \Rightarrow Z(G) = \{ e \}$$
- $$G = GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \Rightarrow Z(G) = \{ \lambda I : \lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{\times} \}$$

<br/>

**Inner Homomorphism**

Let's say we want to find a homomorphism $f$ such that:
$$
G \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} Aut(G) \\
Aut(G) = \{ \text{All isomorphisms } \,  h: G \rightarrow G\} \\
$$
Where the group operation of $Aut(G)$ is composition.

What this means is that given an element $g$ in $G$, we have to give an isomorphism from $G$ to itself.
i.e.
$$
f(g) = \text{ some isomorphism } f_g: G \rightarrow G
$$

**Initial Suggestion**:
$$
f(g)(h) = f_g(h) = gh
$$
(the $f$ that's mapped to $g$, applies $g$ to every $h \in G$)

This $f(g)$ is an isomorphism of _Sets_, it is bijective. \
But the problem is that it <ins>isn't</ins> an isomorphism of _Groups_!
$$
f_g(hh') \stackrel{must}{=} f_g(h) \times f_g(h') \\
\, \\
f_g(hh') = ghh' \\
f_g(h) \times f_g(h') = ghgh' \\
\, \\
\Rightarrow fg_(hh') \neq f_g(h) \times f_g(h')
$$

**Correct Solution**: \
We can define
$$
f(g)(h) = f_g(h) = g h g^{-1} = \text{ conjugation by } g
$$

This $f$ is called the **Inner Automorphism** of $G$.`

We can easily verify that $f(g) \in Aut(G)$:
$$
\begin{align*}
f_g (h h') &= ghh'g^{-1} \\
&= ghg^{-1}  gh' g^{-1}  \\
&= f_g(h) \times f_g(h')
\end{align*}
$$

Also, $f(g)$ is bijective, because we can exhibit an inverse for it:
$$
f(g) \cdot f(g^{-1}) = e \\
f(g^{-1}) \cdot f(g) = e \\
$$

Before any confusion occurs, note that both $f$ and $f(g)$ are maps and we need to examine the properties of both of them.

**Note**: this $f$ is itself a homomorphism:
$$
f(gg') = f(g) \circ f(g')
$$
Remember that the group operation between automorphisms $\{ f(g) \}$ is composition.

We can check that:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(gg')(h) &= (gg')h(gg')^{-1} \\
&= gg'h (g')^{-1}g^{-1} \\
\, \\
f(g) \circ f(g')(h) &= f_g (g'h (g')^{-1}) \\
&= g(g'h (g')^{-1}) g^{-1} \\
&= gg'h (g')^{-1} g^{-1} 
\end{align*}
$$

We can also see the **kernel** of this $f$ is:
$$
\begin{align*}
Kernel(f) &= \{ g \in G: f_g(h) = ghg^{-1} = h, \quad \forall h \in G \} \\
&= Z(G)
\end{align*}
$$

**Question**:
Is this $f$ surjective (onto)?

Example:
$$
V = \text{Klein 4-group} = \{ \begin{pmatrix}
\pm 1 & 0 \\
0 & \pm 1
\end{pmatrix} \}
$$

Which is Abelian, because the matrices are diagonal, which means $Z(V) = V$.

So here, $Image(f)$ in $Aut(V)$ is $\{e \}$.

However, $Aut(V)$ itself is non-trivial!

In fact, $Aut(V) \simeq S_3$. \
i.e. $Aut(V)$ is isomorphic to $S_3$.

If $g : V \rightarrow V$ is an automorphism, then it permutes:
$$
\tau_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & +1
\end{pmatrix} \\
\, \\
\tau_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
+1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \\
\, \\
\tau_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

(maps $I$ to itself)

This gives a homomorphism:
$$Aut(V) \rightarrow S_3$$
With the _trivial kernel_.

This map $Aut(V) \rightarrow S_3$ is also surjective (full image), no matter what permutation of $\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3$ you use.

In general (using this $f$):

$$
\begin{align*}
Inn(V) &:= Image(f) \\
&= \{ a(h) = ghg^{-1} : \exists g \in V \}
\end{align*}
$$
is called the group of inner automorphisms.
