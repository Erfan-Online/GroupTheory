# Subgroups
Precisely, a group $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ (denoted as $H \subset G$) if it is:
1. A subset closed under the same group operation,
2. Contains the identity element of $G$, and
3. Has inverses for each element.

### Example #1
_Question_:
What is the subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ which _stabilizes_ the line $y=0$? \
(Meaning that every vector on the line $y=0$ will stay on that line after the tranformation)

**Note** that it's immediately clear that this is a subgroup, because composites stabilize, the identity stabilizes, and the inverses stabilize.

_Answer_: 
$$
H = \{\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} : \, d \neq 0 \}
$$

Because:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax \\ cx \end{pmatrix} == \lambda \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
\, \\
\Rightarrow c = 0 \\
\, \\
GL_n \text{ invertible} \Rightarrow ad \neq 0
$$

[In Quantum terms, this is a matrix whose $| 1\rangle \langle 0|$ term $=0$]

Some trivial examples of subgroups of a group $G$ are:
$$
\{e\} \text{ is a subgroup for all groups } G
$$

<hr/>

### Example #2
_Proposition_:
The subgroups of $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are precisely given by $(b \mathbb{Z}, +)$ for $b$ a fixed integer.

e.g: \
$b=0$ gives the subgroup $(0, +)$. \
$b=1$ gives subgroup $H = G$.

_Proof_:
$a \cdot b + c \cdot b = (a + c) \cdot b$ 

Just remember that if we have a set and we want to check whether it's a subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, we can use the Eucledian algorithm to find the smallest positive integer $b$ in there, then we can see if everything else is a multiple of that.

# Permutations

### Definition
A **permutation** of a finite set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is a bijective function $\sigma: \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. In other words, it's a rearrangement of the elements where each element appears exactly once.

The set of all permutations of $n$ elements forms the **symmetric group** $S_n$, which has $n!$ elements.

### Two-Line Notation
We can write a permutation $\sigma$ as:
$$
\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & \cdots & n \\
\sigma(1) & \sigma(2) & \sigma(3) & \cdots & \sigma(n)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Example**: The permutation that sends $1 \mapsto 3$, $2 \mapsto 1$, $3 \mapsto 2$ is written as:
$$
\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Cycle Notation
There's a more compact notation called **cycle notation**:

- The notation $(123)$ means $1 \mapsto 2$, $2 \mapsto 3$, $3 \mapsto 1$
- Elements not written map to themselves: $(12)$ means $1 \mapsto 2$, $2 \mapsto 1$, $3 \mapsto 3$
- Cycles are equivalent under rotation: $(123) = (231) = (312)$

**Terminology**:
- A **k-cycle** is a cycle involving $k$ elements
- A **transposition** is a 2-cycle (swaps two elements)
- The **identity permutation** can be written as $(1)$ or simply $e$

### Disjoint Cycles
Any permutation can be written as a product of **disjoint cycles** (cycles that don't share any elements).

**Example**: $(123)(45)$ means:
1. Apply the 3-cycle: $1 \mapsto 2$, $2 \mapsto 3$, $3 \mapsto 1$
2. Apply the 2-cycle: $4 \mapsto 5$, $5 \mapsto 4$
3. All other elements (if any) map to themselves

**Important**: Disjoint cycles commute, so $(123)(45) = (45)(123)$.

# Generators

## Definition
A **generating set** of a group $G$ is a subset $S \subseteq G$ such that every element of $G$ can be expressed as a finite product of elements from $S$ and their inverses.

## Single Generator (Cyclic Subgroups)
Let $G$ be any group and $g \in G$. The **cyclic subgroup generated by $g$**, denoted $\langle g \rangle$, is:
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle g \rangle &= \{g^m : m \in \mathbb{Z} \} \\
&= \{e, g, g^{-1}, g^2, g^{-2}, g^3, g^{-3}, \ldots \}
\end{align*}
$$

This is the **smallest subgroup** of $G$ that contains $g$.

**Key Properties:**
- $g^m \cdot g^n = g^{m+n}$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $(g^m)^{-1} = g^{-m}$

## Multiple Generators
For a set $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\} \subseteq G$, the **subgroup generated by $S$**, denoted $\langle S \rangle$, is:

$$
\langle S \rangle = \{ s_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1} s_{i_2}^{\epsilon_2} \cdots s_{i_\ell}^{\epsilon_\ell} : \ell \geq 0, \, s_{i_j} \in S, \, \epsilon_j \in \pm 1\ \}
$$

In other words, $\langle S \rangle$ consists of all finite products of elements from $S$ and their inverses (including the empty product, which gives the identity $e$).

**Important Notes:**
- Elements in the generating set can be repeated in products (e.g., $s_1 \cdot s_1^{-1} \cdot s_2 \cdot s_1$)
- The resulting subgroup may be finite even with infinite possible products
- **Example**: In $S_2$, if $\tau = (12)$, then $\langle \tau \rangle = \{e, \tau\}$ since $\tau^2 = e$


Using the sidenote, we can see that a **generating set** of $S_3$ is $\{ \tau = (12), \sigma = (123) \}$.

## Order of an Element
For any element $g \in G$, the **order** of $g$ is:
- The smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = e$, if such an integer exists
- **Infinite**, if no positive power of $g$ equals the identity

**Key Fact:** The order of $g$ equals the size of the cyclic subgroup $\langle g \rangle$.

### Cardinality of Infinite Order

When we say an element has **infinite order**, we're dealing with a specific type of infinity. Let's be more precise about what this means:

#### Countable Infinity
If $g$ has infinite order, then $\langle g \rangle = \{g^m : m \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is **countably infinite**. This means:

- $|\langle g \rangle| = |\mathbb{Z}| = \aleph_0$ (aleph-null)
- The elements can be listed in a sequence: $e, g, g^{-1}, g^2, g^{-2}, g^3, g^{-3}, \ldots$
- This is the "smallest" infinite cardinality

#### Examples of Infinite Order Elements

1. **Additive Group of Integers**: In $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, the element $1$ has infinite order since no positive power $1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = n$ equals $0$ (except when $n = 0$).

2. **Matrix Groups**: In $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$, the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ has infinite order because:
   $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
   and this never equals the identity matrix for any positive integer $n$.

3. **Real Numbers**: In $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, any non-zero element has infinite order. (Which still has the $\aleph_0$ cardinality because it's a _finite product_)

#### Contrast with Finite Groups
Note that if $G$ is a **finite group**, then every element must have **finite order** by Lagrange's theorem, since the order of any element must divide $|G|$.

#### Set-Theoretic Perspective
The infinite order creates a bijection between $\langle g \rangle$ and $\mathbb{Z}$:
$$f: \mathbb{Z} \to \langle g \rangle \quad \text{where} \quad f(n) = g^n$$

This bijection preserves the group structure, making $\langle g \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (isomorphic to the integers).
