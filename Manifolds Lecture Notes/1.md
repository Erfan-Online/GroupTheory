In simple words, **Manifolds** are "generalized surfaces". The simplest example of a manifold is the surface of a $2d$ sphere. \
In this course, we'll first talk about Topology, then we'll move on to Differentiable Manifolds and at last talk about Differential Forms. The ultimate goal is to reach the generalized **Stokes' Theorem**.

__Definition__: A **Metric Space** $(X, d)$ is a set $X$ with a distance function $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:
