## General Linear group - $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$
In this course, we're more interested in the subset 
$$
\begin{align*}
GL_n(\mathbb{R}) &:= \{A \, : \, det(A) \neq 0\} \\
&= \{A \, : \exists A^{-1} \} \\
& \subset M_n(\mathbb{R})
\end{align*}
$$
Which is called the **General Linear group**.

By restricting ourselves to $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, we gain some things but lose others.

#### Properties

- There is _no addition law_ on $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$. \
    i.e. $A + B \notin GL_n(\mathbb{R})$. \
    e.g. $A + -A = \textbf{0} \notin GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.

- It's also not closed under scalar multiplication by $0$. \
    $0 \times A = \textbf{0} \notin GL_n(\mathbb{R})$

- But it is **closed under (matrix) multiplication**. \
    Two **Proofs**:
    1. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are invertible. 
    Then, $AB$ is invertible, since:
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    (B^{-1} A^{-1})(AB) &= B^{-1}(A^{-1}A)B \\
    &= B^{-1}IB \\ 
    &= I
    \end{align*}
    $$

    2. Using determinant identity:
    $$
    det(AB) = det(A) \times det(B)
    $$
    Then, using
    $$
        GL_n(\mathbb{R}) = \{A \, : \, det(A) \neq 0\} 
    $$
    We see that $AB$ is a member of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.

- It has a multiplication identity, $I$.
- $\forall A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow A^{-1} \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$
- Products in it are associative. $(AB) C = A (BC)$

The last $3$ properties are the ones that define the notion of a **group**.

## Defining a group
A **group** $G$ is a <ins>set</ins> with a <ins>product operation</ins> $\cdot$ where for $g, h \in G$, we have $g \cdot h \in G$ such that:
1. It is _Associative_.
2. It has an identity element $I$ (also referred to as $e$).
3. Every element $g \in G$ has an inverse element $g^{-1} \in G$ such that $g^{-1}g = gg^{-1} = e$.

The common notation for denoting a group is $G = (\text{set of elements}, \text{product operation})$. \
e.g. $GL_n(\mathbb{R}) = (\text{invertible matrices}, \text{matrix multiplication})$ \
e.g. The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with addition is a group denoted as $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +)$.

**Note**:
If $gh = hg$ for all pairs of elements $g, h \in G$, then $G$ is called a **commutative group**, also known as an **Abelian group**.

An example of an Abelian group is the **set of integers** under _addition_ \
(addition is the "product operation" here):
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, ... \}
$$

$$
a + b = b + a \\
e = 0, \quad a + 0 = a \\
"a^{-1}" = -a
$$

Another example of an Abelian group is **any vector space**, excluding any _scalar multiplication_.
