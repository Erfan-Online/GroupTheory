# Subgroups
Precisely, a group $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ (denoted as $H \subset G$) if it is:
1. A subset closed under the same group operation,
2. Contains the identity element of $G$, and
3. Has inverses for each element.

### Example #1
_Question_:
What is the subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ which _stabilizes_ the line $y=0$? \
(Meaning that every vector on the line $y=0$ will stay on that line after the tranformation)

**Note** that it's immediately clear that this is a subgroup, because composites stabilize, the identity stabilizes, and the inverses stabilize.

_Answer_: 
$$
H = \{\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} : \, d \neq 0 \}
$$

Because:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax \\ cx \end{pmatrix} == \lambda \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
\, \\
\Rightarrow c = 0 \\
\, \\
GL_n \text{ invertible} \Rightarrow ad \neq 0
$$

[In Quantum terms, this is a matrix whose $| 1\rangle \langle 0|$ term $=0$]

Some trivial examples of subgroups of a group $G$ are:
$$
\{e\} \text{ is a subgroup for all groups } G
$$

### Example #2
_Proposition_:
The subgroups of $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are precisely given by $(b \mathbb{Z}, +)$ for $b$ a fixed integer.

e.g: \
$b=0$ gives the subgroup $(0, +)$. \
$b=1$ gives subgroup $H = G$.

_Proof_:
$a \cdot b + c \cdot b = (a + c) \cdot b$ 

Just remember that if we have a set and we want to check whether it's a subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, we can use the Eucledian algorithm to find the smallest positive integer $b$ in there, then we can see if everything else is a multiple of that.


# Generators

## Definition
A **generating set** of a group $G$ is a subset $S \subseteq G$ such that every element of $G$ can be expressed as a finite product of elements from $S$ and their inverses.

## Single Generator (Cyclic Subgroups)
Let $G$ be any group and $g \in G$. The **cyclic subgroup generated by $g$**, denoted $\langle g \rangle$, is:
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle g \rangle &= \{g^m : m \in \mathbb{Z} \} \\
&= \{e, g, g^{-1}, g^2, g^{-2}, g^3, g^{-3}, \ldots \}
\end{align*}
$$

This is the **smallest subgroup** of $G$ that contains $g$.

**Key Properties:**
- $g^m \cdot g^n = g^{m+n}$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $(g^m)^{-1} = g^{-m}$

## Multiple Generators
For a set $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\} \subseteq G$, the **subgroup generated by $S$**, denoted $\langle S \rangle$, is:

$$
\langle S \rangle = \{ s_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1} s_{i_2}^{\epsilon_2} \cdots s_{i_\ell}^{\epsilon_\ell} : \ell \geq 0, \, s_{i_j} \in S, \, \epsilon_j \in \pm 1\ \}
$$

In other words, $\langle S \rangle$ consists of all finite products of elements from $S$ and their inverses (including the empty product, which gives the identity $e$).

**Important Notes:**
- Elements in the generating set can be repeated in products (e.g., $s_1 \cdot s_1^{-1} \cdot s_2 \cdot s_1$)
- The resulting subgroup may be finite even with infinite possible products
- **Example**: In $S_2$, if $\tau = (12)$, then $\langle \tau \rangle = \{e, \tau\}$ since $\tau^2 = e$

---
**Sidenote**: There's a more common notation (called the **cyclic notation**) for permutations. 

For example, the notation $(123)$ means that $1 \mapsto 2, \, 2 \mapsto 3, \, 3 \mapsto 1$. The cyclic part comes from the fact that $(123) = (231) = (312)$.

If we don't write down a number, it means that it maps to itself; so $(12)$ is basically $(12)(3)$, meaning that $1 \mapsto 2, \, 2 \mapsto 1, \, 3 \mapsto 3$.

But in general, a permutation can be broken down into a product of disjoint cycles, for example:

$(123)(45)$  indicates two separate actions:
1. The elements 1, 2, and 3 are permuted among themselves in a 3-cycle as described above.
2. At the same time, the elements 4 and 5 are swapped, which is a 2-cycle or transposition.

---

Using the sidenote, we can see that a **generating set** of $S_3$ is $\{ \tau = (12), \sigma = (123) \}$.

## Order of an Element
For any element $g \in G$, the **order** of $g$ is:
- The smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = e$, if such an integer exists
- **Infinite**, if no positive power of $g$ equals the identity

**Key Fact:** The order of $g$ equals the size of the cyclic subgroup $\langle g \rangle$.
