### Review
- $G \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} G'$ is a homomorphism $\Rightarrow f(g.h) = f(g) \times f(h)$
- $f(e) = e'$
- $f(g^{-1}) = f(g)^{-1}$
- Composition: $G \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} G' \stackrel{h}{\rightarrow} G''$
- $h \circ f$ is a homomorphism if both $h$ and $f$ are homomorphisms.

### Image and kernel

Given a homomorphism $f: G \rightarrow G'$,

#### Image
The image is defined as:

$$Image = \{ g' = f(g) \text{ in } G' \} \subset G'$$

_Analogous to the matrix image in linear algebra_, it is the set of all the _outputs_ of the function $f$ applied on the set $G$ that are in the co-domain of the set $G'$.

#### Kernel
The Kernel is defined as:

$$Kernel = \{ g : f(g) = e' \} \subset G'$$

_Analogous to the matrix kernel in linear algebra_, it is the set of all of the _inputs_ of the function $f$ applied on the set $G$ whose output gets mapped to the identity element in the set $G'$.

**Note**: If image $= G'$ and kernel $= \{ e \}$, then we say f is an **Isomorphism**.
(Everything gets mapped, and only the identity element of $G$ gets mapped to the other side's identity.)

**Note**: If $G = G'$ and $f$ is an isomorphism, we say it's an **Automorphism**.

### Normal Subgroups

Both Kernel and Image are subgroups, but Kernel is also a _special_ kind of subgroup, called a **Normal Subgroup**.

When saying $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, denoted as $H \triangleleft G$, we mean that 
$$
\forall g \in G, \quad \forall h \in H, \\
ghg^{-1} = h
$$
In other words, $H$ is "closed under conjugation" of $G$.

#### Verification of Kernels being Normal subgroups
$$
h \in Kernel, \quad g \in G \\
\begin{align*}
f(ghg^{-1}) &= f(g) \times f(h) \times f(g)^{-1} \\
&= f(g) \times e \times f(g)^{-1} \\
&= f(g) \times f(g)^{-1} \times e \\
&= e
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow ghg^{-1} \in Kernel
$$
(Therefore, the kernel is **closed** under conjugation!)

**Note**:
Not all subgroups are normal.
